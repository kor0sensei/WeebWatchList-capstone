I Created this app for anime enthusiasts/watchers to keep track of the status of all the anime they have watched.

This app will do this by giving the user a library of anime to choose from with all the correlating information for each one like episode count, season of release and a synopsis. Weeb WatchList will include the affordance to add anime to user specify anime watchlist and fill out a form for that specific anime where user can choose what date they started/finished the anime, if user wants to drop it, or plans to watch, user rating, user episode count progress. Based on User filling the form out accordingly, that anime will be saved in that user's watchlist and will also be placed on the according pages watching, finished, dropped, or plan to watch
